## Simple Summary

Overhaul SSTORE and SLOAD costs and storage refunds.

## Motivation

This EIP is intended to be an overhaul to storage read/write pricing rules that maintains the benefits of EIPs 2200, 2929, 3298 and 3402, and adds additional benefts, while simplifying the structure of rewards.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Gas |
| `COLD_SLOAD_COST` | `2000` |
| `COLD_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_COST` | `2500` |
| `STORAGE_SLOT_WRITE_COST` | `2900` |
| `STORAGE_SLOT_FILLING_COST` | `17900` |
| `STORAGE_CLEAR_INCENTIVE_GAS` | `1000` |

## Specification

For each storage slot and for each account, we currently (as of EIP 2929) already store a transaction-scoped data structure keeping track of whether or not it has been _accessed_. We extend this to two flags : `accessed` and `modified`.

The "base cost" of `SLOAD` and `SSTORE` are 100. We remove the existing "extra costs" for `SSTORE` as defined in EIP 2929.

#### New SLOAD and SSTORE and CALL/CREATE rules

The "original value" of a storage slot is defined as in [EIP 1283](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1283): it's the value of the storage slot at the start of executing the current transaction. We add new costs according to the following rules:

* If the storage slot is _not_ `accessed` and it gets `SLOAD`ed or `SSTORE`d, charge an additional `COLD_SLOAD_COST` gas and add that storage slot to the `acccessed` set
* If the storage slot is _not_ `modified`, and it gets `SSTORE`'d to a value other than its original value, the following effects take place:
    * Charge an additional `STORAGE_SLOT_FILLING_COST` if the original (meaning, at the start of the transaction) value is zero
    * Charge an additional `STORAGE_SLOT_WRITE_COST` if the original value is nonzero
    * Add that storage slot to the `modified` set
 
#### Refunds 
 
At the end of a transaction execution, for each storage slot:

* If `modified = True` but the new value is the same as the original value, refund `STORAGE_SLOT_FILLING_COST` if the original value was zero or `STORAGE_SLOT_WRITE_COST` if the original value was nonzero
* If `modified = True`, the original value is nonzero, and the new value is zero, refund `CLEAR_INCENTIVE_GAS`

For each account:

* If `modified = True`, but the new balance

## Rationale

This proposal satisfies the following key goals:

* Each refund of N gas can be mapped one-to-one to N gas paid earlier in the transaction for a purpose which no longer deserves to be charged for because its effect was reverted. For example, each 15000 gas refund corresponds to 17900 gas paid to fill that same storage slot earlier in the transaction, and each 2900 gas refund corresponds to 2900 gas paid to edit that same storage slot (which no longer needs to be paid because the storage slot was later modified back to its original value, so no write actually needs to be made). This ensures that gas tokens continue to be non-viable, and that refunds cannot be used to expand the cost of short-term 

This proposal also satisfies the goal that every refund of `UNZEROING_COST` or `MODIFICATION_COST` corresponds to some previous event during that same transaction execution where that same cost was charged, and that previous event _involves the same storage slot_. This prevents gastokens, and ensures that gas spent on execution is bounded to the gaslimit and so refunds cannot contribute to DoS attacks.

It ensures near-optimally fair gas costs for many key applications:

* Anti-reentrancy locks (typically flipped from 0 to 1 right before a child call begins, and then flipped back to 0 when the child call ends) now cost only the gas for _reading_ that storage slot, and not for writing it
* ERC20 approve-and-send (the "approved value" goes from zero to nonzero when the token transfer is approved, and then back to zero when the token transfer processes) similarly only costs storage reading gas and not storage writing gas
* The `CLEAR_INCENTIVE_GAS` adds an incentive to actually clear storage slots, and not leave a value of 1 just in case you want to use that storage slot later.

## Backwards Compatibility

Refunds are currently only applied _after_ transaction execution, so they cannot affect how much gas is available to any particular call frame during execution. Hence, removing them will not break the ability of any code to execute, though it will render some applications economically nonviable.
